# Image Classification using Convolutional neural network(CNN)
Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
The objective is to build and train an image classifier using Convoluted neural Networks, establish a baseline performance of classifier, improve learning and model capacity through data augmentation and use the model to make predictions.
### CIFAR10 Dataset
The model is trained on CIFAR10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000x32 x 32 colour images divided in 10 classes, with 6000 images in each class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
